<h2>Relax Anytime with Savasana</h2>
    <p>Prepare yourself for savasana. Lie down on your yoga map with your arms at your side with palms up. Close your eyes<br>
    and breathe slowly but deeply. Sink into the mat and let your worries slip away. When you are ready, roll on your side<br>
    and use your arms to push yourself to a sitting position with crossed legs. Place your hands in a prayer position.<br>
    Be grateful for all that your have in life. Namaste.</p>
